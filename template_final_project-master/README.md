## Project Description
This Christmas-inspired 2D arcade shooter reimagines the classic Space Invaders with a festive twist. 
Players act as santas sleigh against waves of mischievous Grinch-like invaders determined to steal holiday cheer. 
With snowballs, the game combines fast-paced action with holiday-themed visuals.
